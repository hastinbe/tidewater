//! The rules of the optional on-screen information (`extras`, `docs/design/extras.md`): health bars over units and
//! the game clock with the player's actions per minute. Only rules and text here; `view` draws the bars and `hud` the
//! clock. Nothing of this runs with the options at their defaults.
//!
//! Our own design, not the original's: the original shows a unit's hit points only in the information panel.
//!
//! - **Health bars.** A bar is [`BAR_HEIGHT`] rows high and as wide as the unit's selection box, [`BAR_GAP`] rows above
//!   the box. Its colour is the information panel's health colour ([`crate::info::health_bar`]); the empty part is
//!   [`EMPTY`], the information panel's empty colour. A unit with any hit points shows at least one filled pixel.
//! - **The clock** counts the game's own clock (`savegame::GameClock`: minutes and seconds, with hours once there are
//!   any). **Actions per minute** are the commands the player gave (selecting included) per minute of that clock, shown
//!   from the first full second and as a whole number.
